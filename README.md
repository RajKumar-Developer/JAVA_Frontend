# Campus Management System

Welcome to the Campus Management System project, developed by our 4-member team. This system is designed to efficiently manage student and teacher data for administrators. It's built using Java with libraries like javax.swing, java.awt, and JDBC, and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features

- **Dynamic Software**: We've created a dynamic software solution that provides flexibility in managing campus data.

- **CRUD Functions**: The system offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions for both student and teacher data, making data management a breeze.

- **Secure Access**: Access to student and teacher data is restricted to administrators for enhanced security.

- **Data Storage**: We've utilized SQL for robust data storage and management.

- **OOP Principles**: The codebase employs OOP principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, function overriding, and abstract data types.

- **Multi-Threading**: Multi-threading has been implemented for improved system performance.

## Getting Started
